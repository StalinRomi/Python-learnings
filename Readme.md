### Programming - Way to tell Computers what to do

## What is Python?

### **Dynamically-typed, General purpose programming language**, that supports both object-oriented programming & functional-programming approach.

(**Dynamically-typed** -> Interpreter assigns variables a type at runtime based on the variable's value at that time)

(**General Purpose Programming Language** -> A programming language for building software in a wide variety of application domains)

(**Object-Oriented** -> Classes are used where instance of objects are created, Fundamental element -> objects and methods.)

(**Functional-oriented** -> It emphasizes on the use of functions where each function performs a specific task, Fundamental element -> Variables)

Python is an **interpreted** & High-level programming lanuage.

(**Interpreted** -> Instructions are not directly executed by the target machine, but instead, read and executed by some other program)

(**High - level programming language** -> It has a higher level of abstraction from the computer, and focuses more on the programming logic rather than the underlying hardware components such as memory addressing and register utilization.)

It was created by **Guido Van Rossum** in 1989.

In Python, everything is an **Object**.

## Modules

Its a **Code library**. Its like borowing someone else's code in your program without knowing the implementational of that code.

**2** Types of Modules -

1. **Built - in Module** -> It ships along with the programming language.

2. **External Module** -> We need to install it using a package manager like Pip.

## Comments

A comment is a part of the coding file that the programmer does not want to execute. Its used to either **explain a block of code** or to avoid execution of a specific part of code while testing.

**For single line -> #**

**For multi-line -> ''' '''** (3 Single Quotes OR 3 Double Quotes)
