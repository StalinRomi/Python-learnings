(**General Purpose Programming Language** - A programming language for building software in a wide variety of application domains)

(**Object-Oriented** - Classes are used where instance of objects are created, Fundamental element -> objects and methods.)

(**Functional-oriented** - It emphasizes on the use of functions where each function performs a specific task, Fundamental element -> Variables)
