### 2 Types -

## Explicit conversion - Manual

(Its done by us, using in-built methods like int(), float(), hex(), etc)

## Implicit conversion - Automatic

(In Python, some data-types have higher order while others have lower order. While performing any operations, one variable's data type will be changed to higher order.)

(According to the level, one data type is converted into other by the Python interpreter itself)

## Taking User Input
