### To insert characters that cannot be directly used in a string, we use Escape sequence character.

### / followed by the character you want to insert.

Eg. 1. \n - This gets you new line.

2. print("You are a \"good\" boy") - Here \ is used to avoid " from getting executed.

## Print Separater

Default Character Separater - **Space**, To spearate characters with something else use **sep**.

Eg. print("Hii", "Hello", 5, sep="~")

Now Hi, Hello & 5 will be separated by **~**
